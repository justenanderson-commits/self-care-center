Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I built a website to provide pre-packaged encouragement to anyone in need. It will randomly generate a pre-loaded affirmation or mantra to the user, allow them to clear the message, and then generate another (if requested). The app solves the problem of not having anyone to offer encouragement.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
It would be the same as the pair-project:
1. Go to repo on Github [(https://github.com/justenanderson-commits/self-care-center)]
2. Click Fork > Create New Fork
3. Click Code
4. Copy the SSH url provided by GitHub
5. In the terminal, navigate to the new project repository
6. Type git clone and paste the URL
7. Open the repo in text editor
8. Type open index.html in the terminal
9. Manipulate the application in the browser window

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I probably invested 15 - 18 hours into the project. I'm in week 3 of Mod 1. If I had it to do all over again, I would have started with dynamic element sizing right off the bat. Also, I wondered if there was a styling class I could have created that would have produced DRYer CSS by being able to apply it to all of the text elements on-screen, instead of having to manually configure padding, border, and margins for each individual element.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
Just me and Google. Angie Wirth gave me some hints to guide me toward the classList method that I had forgotten about when I was stuck, but that was about it.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Learning Goals:
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill set

I worked with VS Code, html, CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub, the terminal, and the Google Chrome browser.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
I felt really positive about my own ability on this project. I <strong>definitely</strong> would have perfected the layout a little more (i.e. centering the returned message in the text box a little better) and added additional functionality (i.e. dynamic sizing for different screens) if I <em>wasn't</em> going to be out of town this weekend (as I am now). But for the time I had available to me, and because I really tried to follow the guidelines and complete the project on my own, I feel pretty darn good about it.
